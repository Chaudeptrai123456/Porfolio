        <p class="description">
            From soft brushstrokes to the blaze of battle, this portfolio unfolds the journey of a lone warrior—one who walks through past, present, and future like a living epic.
            Inspired by the timeless spirit of Greek mythology, each illustration becomes a chapter in a visual odyssey:<br>
        <strong>Past</strong>: where memories burn beneath the crimson tree.<br>
        <strong>Present</strong>: where shadows and choices collide.<br>
        <strong>Future</strong>: where fire and blood forge an immortal monument.

          <p className="memory-effect">
            Châu was born in Tiền Giang, in a small market neighborhood where life was simple but full of color. His family didn’t have much, yet laughter echoed through their home like music. His parents loved each other deeply—even their arguments felt like two kids playfully teasing. Châu and his little sister were close, always sharing stories and silly dreams. They didn’t fight, just built forts and imagined worlds where everything felt safe. Even in hardship, their home felt like a secret pocket of joy tucked away from the noise outside.

          <h2>Education</h2>
          <p>
            Châu studied at Nguyễn Đình Chiểu High School in Mỹ Tho, where his curiosity first took root. He later attended the International University under Vietnam National University in Ho Chi Minh City, chasing dreams beyond the market streets he grew up in. His academic journey was full of highs and lows—sweet victories, bitter failures, and quiet lessons. He took a gap year to follow his passion, stepping off the expected path without regret. There were wild days, reckless choices, and moments of deep despair. But through it all, he learned that growth often comes from the places that hurt the most.

    <h2>The Weight of Stillness — When Silence Becomes a Cage</h2>
    <p>
      There was a time when Châu stopped moving—not because he was tired, but because he no longer saw the point. Days blurred into nights, and the fire that once burned in him flickered into ash. He skipped classes, ignored calls, and let dreams gather dust in the corners of his mind. The world outside kept spinning, but inside, he was stuck in a loop of guilt and numbness. He laughed less, slept more, and avoided mirrors that might reflect the truth. It wasn’t anyone else’s fault—he knew that. But knowing didn’t make it easier to forgive himself.
